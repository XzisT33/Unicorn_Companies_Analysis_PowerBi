# Project Analysis
1) Most Unicorns came from the USA i.e. 561 followed by China(173) & India(65). <br>
2) Bytedance sits at the top of the most valued Unicorns with a valuation of $180Bn, Shein and SpaceX follows with $100Bn, Stripe comes next with $95Bn. <br>
3) The Fintech Industry tops this list in terms of Total Fundings with $108Bn, E-Commerce at $74Bn, while Internet Software at $73Bn. <br>
4) Top 3 Continents in terms of distribution of Unicorns are North America with 56% , followed by Asia (29.75%) & Europe (13.72%). <br>
5) 2022 saw a downward trend and a decline in the number of Companies that emerged as Unicorns with 112 Companies joining. This downward trend can be attributed to the negative effects of the pandemic which 
   slowed down consumer spending and this resulted to decreased investment. The effect of this also came as a result of the volatility in the financial markets which made it difficult for startups to raise capital. <br>
